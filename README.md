# my-setup
This repository describes my computer setup (what tools/programs I use, what operating system I use, etc.)


## Operating System
1. Laptop: Because of my schools reliance on Microsoft 360 Products & Services I must either use Windows or macOS on my Laptop for school, out of these two I choose macOS.

2. Desktop: On desktop I typically use a Linux distrobution with a quick or rolling release cycle (e.g. Fedora, Arch, Void, etc.)

3. Server: On servers I typically use a Linux distrobution with a slow release cycle (e.g. Debian, Rocky, etc.)
