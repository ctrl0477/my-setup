# my-setup
This repository describes my computer setup (what tools/programs I use, what operating system I use, etc.)


## Operating System
1. Laptop: Because of my schools reliance on Microsoft 360 Products & Services I must either use Windows or macOS on my Laptop for school, out of these two I choose macOS.

2. Desktop: On desktop I typically use a Linux distrobution with a quick or rolling release cycle (e.g. Fedora, Arch, Void, etc.)

3. Server: On servers I typically use a Linux distrobution with a slow release cycle (e.g. Debian, Rocky, etc.)

## Web Browser
The web browser I use is Vivaldi. Vivaldi is a chromium-based web browser that is majority opensource; the only part of Vivaldi that isn't opensource is the UI. I use Vivaldi for the following reasons:
1. It's chromium-based making it play nicely on the web.
2. It's based in Norway, not the USA.
3. It's company doesn't have any major negative political drama.
4. It's strong stance against AI integration.
5. It's CEO, Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner isn't a dickhead.
